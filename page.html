            <h2>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</h2>
            <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a long-lasting disorder in which a person experiences uncontrollable and recurring thoughts (obsessions), engages in repetitive behaviors (compulsions), or both. People with OCD have time-consuming symptoms that can cause significant distress or interfere with daily life.

                <br>
                <strong>Signs and Symptoms of OCD</strong>
                <br>People with OCD may have obsessions, compulsions, or both. Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that are intrusive, unwanted, and make most people anxious. Common obsessions include:
                Fear of germs or contamination
                Fear of forgetting, losing, or misplacing something
                Fear of losing control over one’s behavior
                Aggressive thoughts toward others or oneself
                Unwanted, forbidden, or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion, or harm
                Desire to have things symmetrical or in perfect order
                
               <br> Compulsions are repetitive behaviors a person feels the urge to do, often in response to an obsession. Common compulsions include:
                Excessive cleaning or handwashing
                Ordering or arranging items in a particular, precise way
                Repeatedly checking things, such as that the door is locked or the oven is off
                Compulsive counting
                Praying or repeating words silently
                 
               <br>
               <strong>People with OCD generally:</strong> 
                <br>Can’t control their obsessions or compulsions, even when they know they’re excessive.
                Spend more than 1 hour a day on their obsessions or compulsions.
                Don’t get pleasure from their compulsions but may feel temporary relief from their anxiety.
                Experience significant problems in daily life due to these thoughts or behaviors.  
                </p>
            <p>Some people with OCD also have a tic disorder involving repetitive movements or sounds. Motor tics are sudden, brief, repetitive movements, such as eye blinking and other eye movements, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head or shoulder jerking. Vocal tics include things like repetitive throat-clearing, sniffing, or grunting sounds. It is common for people with OCD to also have a diagnosed mood disorder or anxiety disorder.
             <br>
              <strong>People with OCD generally:</strong>
                
               <br> Treatment helps many people, even those with the most severe forms of OCD. Mental health professionals treat OCD with medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of treatments.
                Psychotherapy-
                Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of talk therapy that helps people recognize harmful or untrue ways of thinking so they can more clearly view and respond to challenging situations. CBT helps people learn to question these negative thoughts, determine how they impact their feelings and actions, and change self-defeating behavior patterns. 
                Exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP): Research shows that ERP, a specific type of CBT, effectively reduces compulsive behaviors, even for people who do not respond well to medication. With ERP, people spend time in a safe environment that gradually exposes them to situations that trigger their obsession (such as touching dirty objects) and prevent them from engaging in their typical compulsive behavior (such as handwashing). 
                Medication
                Health care providers may prescribe medication to help treat OCD. The most common medications prescribed for OCD are antidepressants that target serotonin, a chemical transmitter in the brain involved in depression and OCD. The largest category of antidepressants is called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
                
               <br> Consequences of misdiagnosis of OCD-
                Misdiagnosis can result in a delay in receiving the correct treatment, which can lead to an escalation of symptoms and increased distress. The person may experience worsening of their obsessions and compulsions, impacting their quality of life.
                Misdiagnosis might lead individuals to believe that their struggles are a result of personal failings rather than a treatable disorder. This can exacerbate feelings of shame or guilt, further impacting their mental health.

            <h2>Bipolar Disorder</h2>
            <p>Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental illness that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. These shifts can make it difficult to carry out day-to-day tasks.
               <br> There are three types of bipolar disorder.
                •	Bipolar I disorder is defined by manic episodes that last for at least 7 days (nearly every day for most of the day) or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the person needs immediate medical care. Usually, depressive episodes occur as well, typically lasting at least 2 weeks. Episodes of depression with mixed features (having depressive symptoms and manic symptoms at the same time) are also possible. Experiencing four or more episodes of mania or depression within 1 year is called “rapid cycling.”
                •	Bipolar II disorder is defined by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes. The hypomanic episodes are less severe than the manic episodes in bipolar I disorder.
                •	Cyclothymic disorder (also called cyclothymia) is defined by recurring hypomanic and depressive symptoms that are not intense enough or do not last long enough to qualify as hypomanic or depressive episodes.
                
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                
              <br>  Causes of Bipolar Disorder
                Brain structure and functioning: Some studies show that the brains of people with bipolar disorder differ in certain ways from the brains of people who do not have bipolar disorder or any other mental disorder. Learning more about these brain differences may help scientists understand bipolar disorder and determine which treatments will work best. At this time, health care providers base the diagnosis and treatment plan on a person’s symptoms and history, rather than brain imaging or other diagnostic tests.
                Genetics: Some research suggests that people with certain genes are more likely to develop bipolar disorder. Research also shows that people who have a parent or sibling with bipolar disorder have an increased chance of having the disorder themselves. Many genes are involved, and no one gene causes the disorder. 
                
               <br> Treatment For Bipolar Disorder
                Medication-
                The most common types of medications that health care providers prescribe include mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics. Mood stabilizers such as lithium or valproate can help prevent mood episodes or reduce their severity. Lithium also can decrease the risk of suicide. Health care providers may include medications that target sleep or anxiety as part of the treatment plan.
                Because people with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when they are experiencing mania or hypomania, it is important for health care providers to take a careful medical history to ensure that bipolar disorder is not mistaken for depression.
                </p>
            <p>Psychotherapy-
               <br> Psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, can be an effective part of treatment for people with bipolar disorder. Psychotherapy is a term for treatment techniques that aim to help people identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. This type of therapy can provide support, education, and guidance to people with bipolar disorder and their families.
                Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an important treatment for depression, and CBT adapted for the treatment of insomnia can be especially helpful as part of treatment for bipolar depression.
                Treatment may also include newer therapies designed specifically for the treatment of bipolar disorder, including interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) and family-focused therapy.
                Coping with bipolar disorder
                Living with bipolar disorder can be challenging, but there are ways to help make it easier.
               <br> •	Work with a health care provider to develop a treatment plan and stick with it. Treatment is the best way to start feeling better.
                •	Follow the treatment plan as directed. Work with a health care provider to adjust the plan, as needed.
                •	Structure your activities. Try to have a routine for eating, sleeping, and exercising.
                •	Try regular, vigorous exercise like jogging, swimming, or bicycling, which can help with depression and anxiety, promote better sleep, and support your heart and brain health.
                •	Track your moods, activities, and overall health and well-being to help recognize your mood swings.
                •	Ask trusted friends and family members for help in keeping up with your treatment plan.
                •	Be patient. Improvement takes time. Staying connected with sources of social support can help.
                
               <br> Consequences of Misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder-
                Self-diagnosis can lead to major problems because bipolar disorder and depression can be somewhat similar in some ways. Misdiagnosis can lead you to take medications that you are not supposed to take or even do lifestyle changes which could exacerbate symptoms. It could lead to more anxiety, fear or self-blame and gulit. So its very important to seek help from a certifies psychologist or therapist.

            <h2>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</h2>
            <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development.
              <br>
               <strong> SYMPTOMS</strong>
               <br> •	Inattention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and these problems are not due to defiance or lack of comprehension.
                •	Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate, or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. In adults, hyperactivity may mean extreme restlessness or talking too much.
                •	Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsivity could also include a desire for immediate rewards or the inability to delay gratification. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences.
                
               <br> TREATMENT FOR ADHD
                While there is no cure for ADHD, currently available treatments may reduce symptoms and improve functioning.
                Medication- ADHD medications reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity and improve their ability to focus, work, and learn.
                Stimulants. The most common type of medication used for treating ADHD is called a “stimulant.” Although it may seem unusual to treat ADHD with a medication that is considered a stimulant, it works by increasing the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine, which play essential roles in thinking and attention.
                Behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that aims to help a person change their behavior. It might involve practical assistance, such as help organizing tasks or completing schoolwork, or working through emotionally difficult events. Behavioral therapy also teaches a person how to:
                •	Monitor their own behavior
                •	Give oneself praise or rewards for acting in a desired way, such as controlling anger or thinking before acting
                
               <br> Cognitive behavioral therapy helps a person learn how to be aware and accepting of one’s own thoughts and feelings to improve focus and concentration. The therapist also encourages the person with ADHD to adjust to the life changes that come with treatment, such as thinking before acting, or resisting the urge to take unnecessary risks.
                Family and marital therapy can help family members and spouses find productive ways to handle disruptive behaviors, encourage behavior changes, and improve interactions with the person with ADHD.
                
                </p>
            <p><strong>CONSEQUENCES OF MISDISGNOSIS OF ADHD</strong>
                <br>If you think you might have ADHD then you should consult an certified therapist rather than taking help from internet. While some resources could be trustful many could misleading. Like misdiagnosis could lead to Misunderstandings, physiological and psychological effects like self blame or stigma, etc.
